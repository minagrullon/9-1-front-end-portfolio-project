#### User Stories

- As the user, I want to be shown a list of poets upon entering the page.

- As a user, I want to find a search bar and be able to submit the name of an author to search thru their poems.

- As a user, I will find a link that will redirect me to a page populated by a random poem.

- As a user, if I try to submit with no entry in the search box, I will see a message telling me to enter a valid name to search so that I cannot submit without entering a value
